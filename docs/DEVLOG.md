# Development log

Working notes for EA888 Lab development on `claude-dev`. Baseline: `05dcca2` (v1.2.0 source).

## State flow (as found in v1.2.0)

- **Canonical state**: one object `state` in `src/assets/app.js`, created by `C.createInitialState()` /
  `C.normalizeState()` from `sim.js` and persisted to `localStorage['ea888_lab_v120_state']` by `saveState()`.
- **Build signature**: `engineSignature()` hashes selections, tune, assembly, oil and dyno config. A dyno result is
  "current" only while `state.lastDynoSignature === engineSignature(state)`; any hardware/tune change makes it stale.
  `benchSignature()` does the same for bench tests and also covers wear/damage.
- **Dyno**: `startDyno()` calls `C.simulateEngine(state)` once, then reveals the samples over ~5.6 s;
  `finishDyno()` stores it as `state.lastDyno`, prepends it to `state.dynoRuns` and applies wear/damage.
- **Drag**: requires a current dyno; the realtime race (`createRealtimeRun`/`stepRealtimePhysics`) and the
  analytic `C.simulateDrag()` both interpolate torque from the stored dyno samples.
- **Turbo (v1.2.0)**: no compressor map. Boost = requested boost × logistic spool curve around `turboSpoolRpm`;
  power is capped by a scalar `turboMaxHp`; shaft speed, EMP and IAT are linear functions of a "turbo load %".
- **Race audio**: `ensureEngineAudio()` builds a WebAudio graph from the PCM bank in `audio-bank.js`
  (decoded once per AudioContext), `stopEngineAudio({hard})` stops/disconnects voices; smoke test checks 3 races.

## 1. Dyno result consistency (done)

Bug: `simulateEngine()` kept simulating to the rev limit after a critical failure, and peaks, maxima, reliability,
warnings and wear were computed over the whole sweep. An abort at 5900 rpm could therefore show a peak at 7900 rpm
(838 such configurations existed in the baseline, e.g. HX52 + RON95 + knock control off).

Now (`dynoResultVersion: 2`):

- The pull stops at the sample where a failure is detected (`criticalFailure()` returns a structured event with
  `code`, `system`, `severity`). `options.stopAtRpm` provides the same for an operator abort.
- Result fields: `status` (`completed` / `aborted` / `failed-to-start`), `abortRpm`, `abortReason`, `abortKind`
  (`engine-failure` / `operator` / `failed-to-start`), `samples[]` (replaces `curve`), `targetRpm`, `rpmReached`.
  The old rating label moved from `status` to `rating`.
- All summaries come from `summarizeDynoSamples(samples)`. Aborted runs quote the *highest observed* value
  (labelled partial with `*`) or `—` below 5 samples, and have `reliabilityScore: null`.
- Wear is integrated per sample (`dynoWearFromSamples`), damage comes from the failure event
  (`dynoFailureDamage`), both applied by `commitDynoResult()`; the app no longer computes them itself.
- Results saved by v1.2.0 are repaired on load (`sanitizeDynoResult`): samples above the failure rpm and the
  warnings/bottleneck derived from them are dropped.
- UI: partial runs show "Hoogst waargenomen", an abort notice, no score, a red abort line with the unmeasured
  range shaded; the live display never scales to values that have not been revealed yet. Operator aborts are kept
  as partial runs with the wear of the portion actually run (v1.2.0 discarded them and charged nothing).
- Drag and challenges require `isCompletedDyno()`.
- Tests: `tests/test_dyno_result.js` (run from `tests/test_sim.js`) plus browser checks `dyno_abort_*` in
  `tools/browser_smoke.py`.

## Technical debt / contradictions found

- The garage reliability card printed `r.weakestLink`, a field that never existed ("undefined"); fixed to
  `bottleneck`.
- `__EA888_DEBUG__.setTransmissionForTest` re-signs a stale dyno after changing the gearbox (test-only shortcut).
- `tools/browser_smoke.py` hardcodes `/usr/bin/chromium` and the list of script files it injects.
- `tools/generate_sim_v6.py` would overwrite `src/assets/sim.js` from an old template; treat it as legacy.
- `wear` (0 = new) and `damage` are both shown as percentages; labels must keep "slijtage" vs "schade" distinct.
